#Task 1 Install Git and GitHub
#I cannot do this because my computer does not have enough space to fit Git and Github command line stuff
#All the space that's left is required. 
#Although frankly some command line stuff being 20 gigs is goshdarn ridiculous in the first place
#I can barely spare a single gig much less 20!

#Task 2
#If I were to install a new git repository I would do it like this.
#echo "# lab11" >> README.md
#git init
#git add README.md
#git commit -m "first commit"
#git branch -M main
#git remote add origin https://github.com/Alyosha-ctrl/lab11.git
#git push -u origin main

#I will still put the file there though not through command line
print("Hello World")

#Task 3
from listStore import my_list
print(my_list)

#Task 4
#I got to ___
